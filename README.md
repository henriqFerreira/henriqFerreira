I'm currently 17 years old, attending the last year of high school and very ambitious for the future I want.

Very interested in anything that involves programming, from Web Design to Computer Science or more, these things just fascinate me!

I'm currently learning Web Design more deeply and also starting to learn about OS and low-level languages, it is quite impressive.
